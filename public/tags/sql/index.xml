      <description>Relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite3 represent and store data in tables and rows.
 They&amp;rsquo;re based on a branch of algebraic set theory known as relational algebra.
 Mongo query targets of data are technically represented as BSON (binary JASON).
 Relational databases use Structured Querying Language (SQL), making them a good choice for applications that involve the management of several transactions.
 ACID - Atomicity (each transaction be &amp;ldquo;all or nothing&amp;rdquo;), Consistency (any transaction will bring the database from one valid state to another), Isoloation (concurrent execution of transactions results in a system state that would be obtained if transactions were executed sequentially), Durability (once a transaction has been committed, it will remain so)</description>
