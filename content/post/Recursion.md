# [Recursion](https://leetcode.com/explore/featured/card/recursion-i/250/principle-of-recursion/1439/)

>   Recursion is an approach to solving problems using a function that calls itself as a subroutine.

>Each time a recursive function calls itself, it reduces the given problem into subproblems. 


### Not to have an infinite loop


- A simple` base case` (or cases) â€” a terminating scenario that does not use recursion to produce an answer.

- A set of rules, also known as `recurrence relation` that reduces all other cases towards the base case.
